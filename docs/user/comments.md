# Comment Functionality - User Guide

This guide explains how to use the comment functionality in the bulletin board service.

## Viewing Comments

When you view a post, the comments section is displayed below the post content. The comments section shows:

- The total number of comments for the post
- A form for creating new comments
- A list of all comments and their replies

Comments are displayed in chronological order, with the oldest comments at the top. Replies to comments are displayed below their parent comment, indented to show the relationship.

## Creating a Comment

To create a new comment:

1. Scroll to the comment form at the top of the comments section
2. Enter your name in the "작성자" (Author) field
3. Enter your comment in the "댓글 내용" (Comment Content) field
4. Click the "댓글 작성" (Create Comment) button

Your comment will appear immediately in the comments list.

## Creating a Reply

To reply to a comment:

1. Click the "답글" (Reply) button on the comment you want to reply to
2. In the reply form that appears, enter your name in the "작성자" (Author) field
3. Enter your reply in the "답글 내용" (Reply Content) field
4. Click the "답글 작성" (Create Reply) button

Your reply will appear immediately below the comment you replied to.

## Editing a Comment

To edit one of your comments:

1. Find your comment in the comments list
2. Click the "수정" (Edit) button on your comment
3. In the prompt that appears, edit your comment text
4. Click "OK" to save your changes

Your edited comment will appear immediately with the updated content.

> Note: You can only edit comments that you created. The edit button will only appear on your own comments.

## Deleting a Comment

To delete one of your comments:

1. Find your comment in the comments list
2. Click the "삭제" (Delete) button on your comment
3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, click "OK" to confirm deletion

Your comment will be removed immediately from the comments list. If you delete a comment that has replies, all the replies will also be deleted.

> Note: You can only delete comments that you created. The delete button will only appear on your own comments.

## Comment Notifications

When you perform an action related to comments (create, reply, edit, delete), a notification will appear at the bottom of the screen to confirm the action was successful. The notification will disappear automatically after a few seconds.

## Tips

- Your name is remembered between comments, so you only need to enter it once per session
- You can press Escape to close the reply form without submitting
- Comments support basic text formatting, including line breaks
- The comment count at the top of the comments section is updated automatically when you add or delete comments
